The ood_tel folder contains open source images of TELs and other military hardware gathered using Advanced Google Image Search
under the option of Free to Use and Distribute. The purpose of this dataset is to test transfer learning with CNN under data
starved regimes.  To use the folder with uploaded models, use the testnetwork.py module and place the ood_tel folder inside a
data folder in your working directory e.g. /workspace/data/ood_tel.

NOTE:  The original operational (training/val/test) TEL files have not been reviewed for Public Release as of this commit(in process), but will be uploaded as soon as they are cleared.
